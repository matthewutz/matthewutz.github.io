        <p>Matthew Utz is a student at San Jose State University who is studying Digital Media Art. His current focus is on generative art and video, but he also works with code and various other mediums. His work explores the aesthetic possibilities of these tools, and the ability to convey a message or meaning through them.</p>
        
        <p>With both of his parents having degrees in art, he was introduced to art at a young age. Beginning to learn JavaScript at 11 and Photoshop at 12, the utilization of technology in his art-making practice was only natural.</p>
        
        <p>In a more formal capacity, through his studies, he has become proficient in Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Lightroom, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Max.</p>
